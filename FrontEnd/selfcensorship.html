            research questions, teaching specific topics, orsharing specific theories, evidence or ideas, 
            through publication or public or private expression (collectively, "professional expression")
            because of fear of professional (e.g. losign job or promotion), legal (e.g, prosecution or fine), or violent
            retaliation(e.g. harassment, assault), whether from state or non-state sources, against yourself
            or others(e.g. family members).</p>
